### Analysis of cross-country training

In this study, I conduct an analysis of training in athletics.

The dataset was built over several years of running training using a Garmin watch. It contains such attributes as the date and time of the start of training, duration of training, distance, climbs, and so on.

The data can be downloaded [here](https://data.world/soya/garmin-running-clean-combine/workspace/project-summary?agentid=soya&datasetid=garmin-running-clean-combine)
